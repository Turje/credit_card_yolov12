# Cursor Rules for Credit Card YOLOv12 Project

## File Creation Policy
- **CRITICAL: Do NOT create files unless explicitly requested by the user**
- **NEVER create markdown files (.md), README files, or documentation files unless explicitly asked**
- Only create code files when the user explicitly requests them
- When editing, prefer modifying existing files over creating new ones
- If unsure whether to create a file, ask the user first

## Problem-Solving Approach
- **Be honest and transparent** - Admit uncertainty rather than guessing
- **Investigate before assuming** - When questions are not immediately obvious, create a plan to discover the truth
- **Ask clarifying questions** - Seek clarification rather than making assumptions
- **Show reasoning** - Explain how conclusions were reached and what evidence supports them
- **Create investigation plans** - Break down unclear problems into steps to systematically find answers

## Python Coding Style

### General
- Use Python 3.8+ features
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return types
- Prefer `pathlib.Path` over `os.path` for file operations
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Documentation
- Include docstrings for all classes and public functions using triple quotes (""")
- Docstrings should follow the format:
  ```python
  """
  Brief description.
  
  Args:
      param: Description
  """
  ```
- Include type information in docstrings when helpful

### Code Organization
- Use classes for related functionality
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use argparse for CLI interfaces
- Include proper error handling with try/except blocks
- Print informative error messages with context

### Imports
- Group imports: standard library, third-party, local
- Use absolute imports when possible
- Keep imports at the top of the file

### Error Handling
- Use try/except blocks for error handling
- Print clear error messages
- Include traceback when debugging
- Return appropriate exit codes (0 for success, 1 for failure)

### Path Handling
- Always use `pathlib.Path` for file paths
- Use `.exists()` to check file existence
- Use `.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` for directory creation
- Prefer absolute paths when working with tool calls

### Code Examples
- When creating example code, include comments explaining usage
- Include error checking and validation
- Make examples runnable and self-contained

## Project-Specific Conventions

### Dataset Handling
- Support both COCO and YOLO formats
- Handle dataset splits (train/val/test)
- Check for annotation files before processing
- Provide clear error messages when files are missing

### Model Training
- Support YOLOv8 model sizes (n, s, m, l, x)
- Use configurable parameters (epochs, batch size, image size)
- Save models to specified output directories
- Print training progress and results

### Visualization
- Use matplotlib for plotting
- Save visualizations to appropriate output directories
- Include clear labels and titles in plots
- Use appropriate color schemes

## General Best Practices

### Code Changes
- Read existing files before making changes
- Preserve existing code style and patterns
- Make minimal changes to achieve the goal
- Test changes when possible

### Communication
- Be concise and direct
- Explain what you're doing when making significant changes
- Ask for clarification if requirements are unclear
- Don't make assumptions about user intent

### Tool Usage
- Prefer reading files before editing
- Use appropriate tools for the task
- Batch related operations when possible
- Check for linter errors after making changes
